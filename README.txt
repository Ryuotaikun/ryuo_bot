Basic Twitch Bot able to moderate a channel and interact with users

Functions include:
- Tracking chat history
- Timing out links and banned words
- Reacting to custom commands
- Reacting to subscriptions

To add RyuoBot to your Twitch Chat, go into a chat where it is already active
(i.e. www.twitch.tv/Ryuotaikun) and type "!connect new <channel>" in the chat.

To remove it again just type "!ryuo exit" in your chat. This command is only
available to the broadcaster and the moderators

Currently the standart mode of RyuoBot is muted. If you want it to use the chat
actively just type "!ryuo unmute". You can mute it again with "!ryuo mute"
